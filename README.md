Taking track information gathered from GPS data in a project of TUMFTM to calculate and simulate forces acting on the vehicle.
Source of the data: https://github.com/TUMFTM/racetrack-database

For the moment, interprets the data points in the racetrack database to recreate the left and right track limit lines.
This could later be used to calculate the curvature of the track.
